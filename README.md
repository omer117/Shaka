# SHAKA
## _platform for surfers_

Shaka is a platform created for surfers, based on an online store for surfing products such as surfboards, surfboards, and wetsuits.
But with a twist, Shaka finds the user on the beach closest to his home and knows what the waves are like there.
Also in the weather area, you can find more weather on other beaches in Israel
(currently works only in Israel).




## Why did you choose to build Shaka?
I chose to do this project out of a real need, it can develop into a real and great product, I don't know a platform that is both an online store and an accurate weather forecast .


## Who are you?
> My name is Omar Asraf, I am a full-stack programmer full of ambition and hunger to develop, personally and professionally.
I developed Shaka out of my love for programming and surfing, and I'm more than happy that I was able to express it in a great way with the tools I learned.



## What I learned throughtout the project 
I'll be honest, at first, I didn't think it would take me a lot of time or at least that it wouldn't be particularly difficult, a simple shopping site what could go wrong?

So it's not exactly like that, you have to consider a lot of things,
On the front-End, you need to build it precisely and be extremely careful to prevent over-rendering of React, you want the site to run smoothly and be beautiful.

I learned a lot of CSS for the project, and I tried a lot of new things that I didn't know at a sufficient level before, at the backend level there were quite a few attempts, with weather API which limits me in reading, I had to build a cache mechanism that would help me properly manage the withdrawals and now every day is programmed to do it by itself.


Building the interface of the client with the server and of the server with the database was very interesting, and everything now sits in the cloud (thanks to Heroku)
And there are quite a few more, but these are the main titles that taught me.
